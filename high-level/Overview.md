- ML: Subset of AI, algorithms learn, iterate and make predictions/decisions.
- LLMs: Specific ML: Human language at scale. Models (i.e. GPT) have large amount of data to learn from for an input <> output pattern. 2010s start.
- Generative AI: Creating outputs with AI in various formats (text, images, music,etc)
